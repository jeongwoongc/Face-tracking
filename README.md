## Face-tracking camera

This is a face-tracking camera using OpenCV and an arduino. I will be testing my own custom model trained using a customized VGG16 architecture model and will be implementing both the pre-trained model within OpenCV (resnet SSD). The camera will be able to track the face and center it to the middle of the screen.
